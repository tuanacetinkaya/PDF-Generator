# Issues on Process

- TOP: Save the received submission id to a state and send a request to get the pdf link

- Phone component onChange could not be connected/hooked to FormFactory's onChange since it's a class component unlike other arrow functions
- FileUpload component added but onChange does not function since uploaded file links to jotform automatically, not sure how to do that
- sorting the 'content' subelement of json does not work with .sort() function, figured a way to separate the subelement into it's own object and tried to sort the whole object but the program does not recognise .sort as a function applicable to json object (even tried to call with Object.values(elements.content).sort , did not worked either)

# Planned

- set a header for the application to replace React App label
- arrange each form header to hold the form title
- add a button (?) to download the requested pdf
- style the components

# If finished early

- work on error handling of fetch function to print a visible error output if the request has made with an invalid api-key or to a forbidden form
- might work on an authentication function let the user to login their jotform account to reach into their own forms and include them
- if the above function implemented, find a way to generate an api-key for each user to reach their own forms

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
